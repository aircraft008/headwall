A binary distribution for the Raspberry Pi can be downloaded from:

http://hedmanshome.se/bridge-dist.img

It will fill a 4GB SD Card with a ready-to-go system.

Install with:
# dd if=bridge-dist.img of=/dev/<your-disk> bs=4M

Move it to the Pi and boot.

Passwords: "raspi"
SSH is enabled: user pi and root.
Graphical console is enabled.
Serial console is enabled (requires a USB level converter for the serial pin header).

There is two usable IP-addresses to use from eth0:
192.168.2.58 and 192.168.1.50
You can find the web pages there.

You may pre-edit the file /etc/network/interfaces on the SD card to get an IP address that suits you.

As soon as you have the GUI pages going, go to SETUP page and choose mode and review the IP addresses.
